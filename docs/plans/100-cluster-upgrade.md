# Plan 100 — upgrade the cluster to current releases

Status: **PLANNED** (2026-10-01). No change to the production cluster until every Vagrant upgrade test passes and the
operator approves.

## Decisions (operator, 2026-10-01)

- Upgrade every component to its latest release, kagent excepted (left as it is).
- PostgreSQL 18: **option A** — in-place major upgrade by CNPG on the same Debian bullseye image line
  (`18.6-system-bullseye`, pinned by digest). The move to the trixie image line is a later, separate step.
- ScyllaDB: move from 6.2 (last AGPL release) to the source-available 2025.x/2026.x line (free tier: 50 vCPU / 10 TB
  per organisation; we run `--smp=2`).
- Kubernetes stops at **1.36.5**: no Istio release supports 1.37 and Cilium 1.20 is tested only to 1.36. 1.37 waits for
  Cilium 1.21 and Istio 1.32.
- Host changes on `ten` (kubeadm, kubelet, containerd, Cilium) run **through Ansible playbooks**, never by hand.
- **Every step is first proven in a full Vagrant upgrade test**; production changes start only after all tests pass and
  the operator approves, one step at a time.

## Defects to fix first (they break the upgrades)

1. Cilium `bpf-lb-sock-hostns-only=true` is set by `kubectl patch` (ops `bootstrap.sh`), not in the Helm values: any
   `helm upgrade` drops it and breaks Istio. Move it to `socketLB.hostNamespaceOnly: true` in `setup-kubeadm.yml`.
2. External Secrets runs `installCRDs: false`: its CRDs are whatever was first installed and are never upgraded.
3. velero-plugin-for-aws 1.11.1 belongs to Velero 1.15; Velero 1.18 pairs with 1.14.x.
4. Two containerd installs: Debian's 1.7.24 and nerdctl-full's 2.0.2 (with its own unit in /usr/local). One must go.
5. containerd 1.7.24 is below the Kubernetes 1.34 floor (1.7.28).
6. The Postgres image `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17` is a deprecated rolling tag: pin a digest.
7. Strimzi v1beta2 templates (`kafka-users.yaml`, `kafkatopic-events.yaml`, ops test-realtime.yml) must move to v1.
8. local-path-provisioner chart is unpinned; its image pre-pull says 0.0.36 while 0.0.35 runs.

## The Vagrant upgrade test

A new `tests/ansible/test-upgrade.yml` with `task test:upgrade`, run detached like the DR drill.

1. **Baseline = production today.** VMs on Debian **trixie** (the current box is bookworm: change it), the kubeadm
   stack at today's versions through the same playbooks and charts production uses.
2. **Seed data** that must survive: Postgres rows and a CNPG backup, Kafka topics with messages, Scylla keyspaces with
   rows, Mimir series, Tempo traces, ClickHouse logs, a Grafana dashboard, SonarQube project.
3. **Run every step through the new upgrade playbooks / git value changes, in production order.** After each step:
   all pods ready, Argo-equivalent sync clean, the seeded data read back, the service's own health check.
4. **End:** the k6 smoke, the DR drill suites (Velero + barman restore), and a check that every version is the target.
5. Any failure stops the run with diagnostics (events, describe, logs) — the harness pattern from the DR drill.

New playbooks (ops): `upgrade-kubeadm.yml` (one minor per run, `kubeadm upgrade apply`, kubelet/kubectl, drain-free
single node), `upgrade-containerd.yml`, Cilium/Istio/Gateway-API steps as variables of the existing playbooks.

## Production rollout (after all tests pass and approval)

Waves in this order, one step at a time, each verified before the next:

0. Backups (Velero all namespaces, CNPG backup + `pg_dumpall` to the Pi, Scylla Manager backup, etcd snapshot) and the
   eight defects above.
1. Patches: cert-manager 1.20.4, CNPG 1.30.1, Velero 1.18.4 + plugin 1.14.4, versitygw 1.8.0, local-path 0.0.37,
   kube-prometheus-stack 91.8.2, Alertmanager, blackbox, Grafana 12.4.12, Mimir 2.17.11, Fluent Bit 4.2.8,
   Argo CD 3.3.14.
2. Platform: Cilium 1.19.8 → k8s 1.34.12 → containerd 2.3 → k8s 1.35 → Cilium 1.20.2 → Gateway API v1.5 → Istio
   1.27 / 1.29 / 1.31 → k8s 1.36.5.
3. Operators and data: External Secrets 2.11, Argo CD 3.5, cert-manager 1.21, Strimzi 1.2 + Kafka 4.3.1, Scylla
   operator + ScyllaDB + Manager, PostgreSQL 18, Valkey 9.1.
4. Observability majors: Grafana 13, Mimir 3.x, Tempo 3, Fluent Bit 5, ClickHouse 25.8 → 26.8, SonarQube 26.9,
   Centrifugo 6.9.7.

Rules: one component per change; check its history and live effect first; stateful steps shown to the operator with
the exact change before they run.
